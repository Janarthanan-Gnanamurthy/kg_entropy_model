but i warn you if you don’t tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichrist—i really believe he is antichrist—i will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my ‘faithful slave’ as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news” it was in july and the speaker was the wellknown anna pávlovna schérer maid of honor and favorite of the empress márya fëdorovna with these words she greeted prince vasíli kurágin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pávlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the elite all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows “if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between and —annette schérer” “heavens what a virulent attack” replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pávlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa “first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your friend’s mind at rest” said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned “can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling” said anna pávlovna “you are staying the whole evening i hope” “and the fete at the english ambassador’s today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there” said the prince “my daughter is coming for me to take me there” “i thought today’s fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome
